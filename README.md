# TensorFlow Examples

## This fork

Same as main repo, just enforcing everything *must* run on gpu, as a test of [tensorflow-cl](https://github.com/hughperkins/tensorflow-cl)

## Main repo

See: https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples

## What's working

```
examples/
  1_Introduction/
    basic_operations.py  (nuance: changed `tf.int16` to `tf.int32`)
  2_BasicModels/
    linear_regression.py  runs ok now :-)  (needs wheel v0.10.0)
```
